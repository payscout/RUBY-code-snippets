Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language commonly used for building web applications.

In Ruby, an object is a thing; It is the heart of Ruby. That means Ruby manipulates all data on the assumption that the data is an object, allowing for an endless amount of objects with different characteristics.

Please contact you Payscout Support Representative for assistance in matching you with the SDK that best fits your needs.
